{"name":"Scripts","tagline":"","body":"### My Memo Pad.\r\nThis is a place where i try to experiment with new programming languages. As a part of designing an analytical dashboard, i had the chance of evaluating R as a prospective tool. The dashboard had stressed demands with large volumes of data. It was really surprising to see that most of the analytical needs were available in terms of packages and functions.  \r\n\r\n### R scripts\r\nLearning R is as interesting as reading a fiction. It is essential to take the first step to learn R by downloading R from the website and installing the same based on the platform. Once the R environment is in place, it is easier to experiment the R scripts shared.  As a matter of initiating the spirit of learning, a good number of elementary R programs are shared for the benefit of R learners. \r\n\r\n### Join Hands\r\nWelcome to join hands with me in unfolding the capabilities of r programming.  Please write to me for additional inclusions and comments.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
